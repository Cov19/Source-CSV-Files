# Source-CSV-Files
These are some core protein CSV files for easy data wrangling with RapidMiner Studio and/or Neo4J Desktop.

The files come from the following source proteins:
[6NB7](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6NB7) | [6NB8](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6NB8) | [2AJF](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2AJF) | [2GHV](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2GHV)

These were also the same proteins used at the Covid-19 Folding@home [project](https://github.com/FoldingAtHome/coronavirus)

All original data, data files, and source data, and rights of the data go to the original owners and prospective authors. These data files were simply converted so other researchers are able to utilize the same data in their projects for their case studies. Don't forget to source any source data and add any needed references in your annotations.
